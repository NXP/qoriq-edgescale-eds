EDGESCALE-EDS is a set of software agents running on device side which connects to cloud.

The cloud service is located at http://portal.edgescale.org. With the dashboard, user should be able to manage devices and deploy container based applications.

Please follow below instructions to build and deploy software images with LSDK tools.

## To build EDGESCALE-EDS with flexbuild
EDGESCALE-EDS is not enabled by default in flexbuild, you can enable it by setting the build options below in <flexbuild_dir>/configs/build_lsdk.cfg

```
CONFIG_APP_EDGESCALE=y
CONFIG_APP_OPTEE=y
CONFIG_APP_LIBPKCS11=y
CONFIG_APP_SECURE_OBJ=y
# Optional (TEE support option)
CONFIG_EDGESCALE_SECURE_MODE=y
```

To compile custom kernel for EdgeScale
```
$  flex-builder -i clean-linux (optional)
$  flex-builder -c linux -a arm64
```

To only build edgescale components:
```
$ flex-builder -c edgescale -a arm64
```

To build all images with Edgescale enabled by autobuild:
```
$ flex-builder -i auto -a <arch>   # autobuild all firmware, linux, apps components and ubuntu rootfs for all <arch> machines
$ flex-builder -m ls1046ardb       # autobuild all firmware, linux, apps components and ubuntu rootfs for ls1046ardb
```

## To install LSDK with EdgeScale into SD card on host on which SD card is attached

```
$ cd build/images
$ flex-installer -b bootpartition_<lts_version>_arm64_edgescale.tgz  -r rootfs_<lsdk_version>_arm64_edgescale.tgz  -d /dev/sdx
```
