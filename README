EDGESCALE-EDS is a set of software agents running on device side which connects to cloud.

The cloud service is located at http://portal.edgescale.org. With the dashboard, user should be able to manage devices and deploy container based applications.

Please follow below instructions to build and deploy software images with LSDK tools.

## To compile custom kernel for EDGESCALE with flexbuild

```
$  make distclean -C build/linux/kernel/<arch>/output/linux-4.x (optional)        
$  cp packages/apps/edgescale-eds/edgescale_demo_kernel.config packages/linux/linux/arch/arm64/configs
$  flex-builder  -c linux  -a <arch>  -B fragment:edgescale_demo_kernel.config
```

## To build EDGESCALE-EDS with flexbuild

```
$ flex-builder -i autobuild -a <arch> # autobuild all firmware, linux, apps components and ubuntu rootfs for all arch machines
$ flex-builder -m ls1046ardb -a arm64 # autobuild all firmware, linux, apps components and ubuntu rootfs for ls1046ardb
```

## Install LSDK into SD card on target host

```
$ flex-installer -b build/images/bootpartition_<arch>  -r build/images/ubuntu_xenial_<arch>_rootfs.d  -d /dev/sdx
```

## Please Note

EDGESCALE-EDS is not enabled by default in flexbuild,if you want to enable it, you need set the below macro to the file flexbuild/configs/build_lsdk.cfg.

```
ONFIG_BUILD_OPTEE=y
CONFIG_BUILD_LIBPKCS11=y
CONFIG_BUILD_SECURE_OBJ=y
CONFIG_BUILD_QORIQ_EDGESCALE=y
# Optional (TEE support option)
