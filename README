EDGESCALE-EDS is a set of software agents running on device side which connects to cloud.

The cloud service is located at http://portal.edgescale.org. With the dashboard, user should be able to manage devices and deploy container based applications.

Please follow below instructions to build and deploy software images with LSDK tools.

TO compile custom kernel for EDGESCALE with Flexbuild:
$  make distclean -C build/linux/kernel/<arch>/output/linux-4.x (optional)        
$  cp packages/apps/edgescale-eds/edgescale_demo_kernel.config packages/linux/linux/arch/arm64/configs
$  flex-builder  -c linux  -a <arch>  -B fragment:edgescale_demo_kernel.config

TO build EDGESCALE-EDS with Flexbuild:
$ flex-builder -c edgescale-eds -a <arch>
$ flex-builder -i merge-component -a <arch>

Install LSDK into SD card:
$ flex-installer -b build/images/bootpartition_<arch>  -r build/images/ubuntu_xenial_<arch>_rootfs.d  -d /dev/sdx

EDGESCALE-EDS is not enabled by default in flexbuild, to enable it, change CONFIG_BUILD_EDGESCALE_EDS=n to y in flexbuild/configs/build_lsdk.cfg
